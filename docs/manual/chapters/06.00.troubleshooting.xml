    <para>Sometimes, on some installation, attributes and types trees are not loaded.</para>

        <para>If you're under Joomla! 1.5, check if you have installed the latest available version, and if the system plugin 
          <emphasis>Mootools upgrade</emphasis> is activated.</para>

        <para>J4Schema requires a quite number of javascript files to correctly display those two trees. If it's the first time 
          you're using this extension, maybe your browser didn't complete the download from your server.</para>
        <para>To fix that, simply reload the page. Please note that JCE editor loads the plugin using an IFRAME, so you have to
          <emphasis>right click on the screen</emphasis> &#187; <emphasis>this frame</emphasis> &#187; <emphasis>reload this frame</emphasis></para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>If you still can't load the trees, probably there is another plugin conflicting with J4Schema. Sadly some plugin
          "hack" global Javascript object and this causes a lot of problems.</para>
        <para>You should disable all the plugins and try to enable them one by one: in this way you can understand who's conflicting
          with J4Schema.</para>
