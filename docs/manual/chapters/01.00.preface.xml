    <title>Preface</title>

    <para>In June 2011, three main search engines (Google, Bing and Yahoo) created a new standard for semantic search: schema.org.
	  They created a dictionary in order to turn into machine readable some information that only a human being could understand.</para>
	  
	<para>
	  For example, the word "Avatar" could be a lot of things: it could be a film title, an user image on a forum and so on. 
	  We can understand what we're talking about using the context, a machine can't, it needs more information.
	</para>
	  
	<para>
	    To help developers in this task, we have created an extension that allows them to quickly navigate inside the dictionary and 
	    pick the tags they need.
